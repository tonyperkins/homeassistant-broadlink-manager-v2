# API Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What We Just Implemented

### Real Device API Endpoints

All device endpoints now work with actual data storage:

#### âœ… GET /api/devices
- Fetches all devices from StorageManager
- Converts entity format to device format
- Returns array of devices

#### âœ… GET /api/devices/:id
- Fetches single device by ID
- Returns 404 if not found

#### âœ… POST /api/devices
- Creates new device
- Generates entity_id from name
- Saves to metadata.json
- Returns created device

#### âœ… PUT /api/devices/:id
- Updates existing device
- Preserves commands
- Saves changes to storage

#### âœ… DELETE /api/devices/:id
- Deletes device from storage
- Returns 404 if not found

### Storage Integration

Connected to existing storage system:
- Uses `StorageManager` for persistence
- Saves to `/config/broadlink_manager/metadata.json`
- Compatible with existing v1 data structure

### Changes Made

**Files Modified:**
1. `app/api/devices.py` - Implemented all CRUD operations
2. `app/web_server.py` - Added storage_manager to Flask config

**How It Works:**
```python
# Storage manager available in API endpoints
storage = current_app.config.get('storage_manager')

# CRUD operations
storage.get_all_entities()
storage.get_entity(entity_id)
storage.save_entity(entity_id, data)
storage.delete_entity(entity_id)
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Restart Flask Server

**Stop the current Flask server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)

**Start it again:**
```bash
cd app
python main.py
```

### Test in Browser

1. **Refresh the page** (http://localhost:5173)
2. **Click "Add Your First Device"**
3. **Fill in the form:**
   - Name: "Living Room TV"
   - Type: "Media Player"
   - Area: "Living Room"
4. **Click "Create"**

### Expected Result

âœ… Device appears in the list
âœ… Device card shows with icon
âœ… Can edit the device
âœ… Can delete the device
âœ… Data persists (saved to metadata.json)

## Data Storage Location

Devices are saved to:
```
/config/broadlink_manager/metadata.json
```

In development mode, this might be:
```
\config\broadlink_manager\metadata.json
```

## Device Format

**Frontend (Vue):**
```javascript
{
  id: "media_player.living_room_tv",
  name: "Living Room TV",
  entity_type: "media_player",
  area: "Living Room",
  icon: "mdi:television",
  broadlink_entity: "",
  commands: {},
  enabled: true
}
```

**Backend (Storage):**
```json
{
  "media_player.living_room_tv": {
    "entity_type": "media_player",
    "device": "living_room_tv",
    "broadlink_entity": "",
    "area": "Living Room",
    "friendly_name": "Living Room TV",
    "name": "Living Room TV",
    "icon": "mdi:television",
    "commands": {},
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## What Works Now

âœ… **Create Device** - Add new devices via form
âœ… **List Devices** - See all devices in grid
âœ… **Edit Device** - Update device properties
âœ… **Delete Device** - Remove devices
âœ… **Persist Data** - Saves to metadata.json
âœ… **Load on Refresh** - Devices persist across reloads

## What's Next

### Phase 3.3: Command Learning (Next)

Now that device management works, we need:

1. **Command Learner Component** - UI to learn IR/RF commands
2. **Command List Component** - Display learned commands
3. **Command Testing** - Test commands before saving
4. **WebSocket Integration** - Real-time learning feedback

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test the device CRUD** - Make sure create/edit/delete works
2. **Create CommandLearner.vue** - Component for learning commands
3. **Implement command API endpoints** - Learn/test/delete commands
4. **Add WebSocket support** - Real-time command learning

## Summary

âœ… **Phase 3.2 Complete**: Core Components
- Device list âœ…
- Device form âœ…
- Device API âœ…
- Full CRUD working âœ…
- Data persistence âœ…

ðŸŽ¯ **Next**: Phase 3.3 - Command Learning

**Ready to test!** Restart Flask and try creating your first device! ðŸš€
