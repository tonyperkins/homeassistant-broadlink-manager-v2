  - Common commands reference
- **Fan direction support**: All fan entities now include direction control by default
- **Automatic config reload**: Generate Entities button now automatically reloads both Broadlink and YAML configurations
- **Enhanced command sync**: Fan-specific commands (`fan_off`, `fan_reverse`, etc.) now properly sync to metadata
- **Unit tests**: Added comprehensive tests for entity generator to prevent regressions

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed media_player generation to use universal platform instead of unsupported template platform
  - Resolves "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'homeassistant.components.template.media_player'" error
  - Media players now generate as `platform: universal` with companion switches for power control
  - Supports volume control, play/pause, source selection, and other media commands
- **CRITICAL**: Removed climate entity type - template.climate platform removed from Home Assistant
  - Climate entity type no longer available in UI
  - Users should use SmartIR custom integration for AC/Heater control
  - Added documentation link to SmartIR in the UI
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed template platform configuration generating multiple platform entries instead of grouping entities together
  - Multiple entities of same type now correctly grouped under single `platform: template` entry
  - Applies to light, fan, switch, and cover entity types
- Fixed entity generation to include `fan_off` command in turn_off action instead of lowest speed
- Fixed entity generation to include `fan_off` in set_percentage when percentage is 0
- Fixed command mapping to include all `fan_*` prefixed commands during metadata sync
- Fixed direction control not appearing in Mushroom Fan Card due to missing remote command in set_direction action

### Changed
- Fan entities always include direction support (even if no reverse command learned yet)
- Entity generation now calls both `reload_broadlink_config` and `reload_core_config` for complete reload
- Entity generator now groups all entities of the same type under a single platform entry (correct HA syntax)

## [1.10.24] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- Fixed washed out header title "Broadlink" - now uses primary text color
- Fixed washed out command names - now uses primary text color

## [1.10.23] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- Improved text contrast in light mode
- Secondary text color changed from `#5f6368` to `#424242` (darker, more readable)
- Section headers now use theme variable and are bolder (600 weight)

## [1.10.22] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- **Removed ALL auto-detection** - manual toggle only, no exceptions
- **Fixed all hardcoded dark colors** in light mode:
  - Device card backgrounds now white
  - Command group backgrounds now light
  - Hover effects now subtle light gray
  - Device icons now use primary color
  - All text colors use theme variables
  - Log area uses theme colors
- Default is light mode, persists in localStorage

## [1.10.21] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- Improved light mode colors for better contrast and readability
- Added one-time HA theme detection on initial load (no polling/watching)
- If no manual preference saved, detects if HA is in dark/light mode and matches it
- Once user manually toggles, their preference is saved and used instead
- Better color scheme: lighter backgrounds, darker text for light mode

## [1.10.20] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- **Completely removed all HA theme auto-detection** - was causing constant switching
- **Simplified to manual toggle only** - exactly like Everything Presence add-on

## [1.10.18] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- Changed default theme to proper light theme with good contrast

## [1.10.17] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- Eliminated theme flash on page load by detecting HA theme in `<head>` before rendering
- Theme now applies immediately, preventing light-to-dark flash
- Inline script runs synchronously before CSS loads

    - `DELETE /api/entities/<id>` - Delete entity
    - `POST /api/entities/detect` - Auto-detect entities from commands
