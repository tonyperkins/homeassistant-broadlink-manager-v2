## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0-alpha.3] - 2025-10-26

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES
- **Independent Command Storage**: Commands are now stored in `devices.json` instead of relying solely on Broadlink integration storage
  - Existing commands will be automatically migrated on first run
  - Provides better reliability and independence from integration storage
  - **Note**: If you downgrade to alpha.2 or earlier, you may need to re-learn commands

### Added
- **Independent Command Storage System**: Commands stored directly in app's `devices.json`
  - Three storage modes: `manager_only`, `integration_only`, `both` (default)
  - Background polling automatically fetches command codes from integration storage
  - Commands persist even if integration storage is cleared
  - Automatic migration from integration-only storage on startup
- **Manual Refresh Button**: Added refresh button (üîÑ) in command learner dialog
  - Manually triggers polling check for pending commands
  - Useful if automatic file watching misses updates
- **Improved File Watching**: Reduced debounce from 1s to 0.1s for faster command detection
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/commands/check-pending` to manually trigger polling

### Changed
- **Command Learning Flow**: Commands now saved to `devices.json` with "pending" status
  - Background thread polls for actual command codes
  - Updates automatically when codes are available (typically 3-5 seconds)
  - Timeout after 60 seconds with error status
- **Storage Architecture**: Moved from integration-dependent to app-managed storage
  - Better reliability and control
  - Reduced dependency on Home Assistant storage timing
  - Optimistic UI updates for better UX

### Fixed
- **Polling Reliability**: File watcher now more responsive to rapid command learning
- **Command Persistence**: Commands no longer lost if integration storage is cleared
- **Storage Lag Issues**: Background polling handles HA storage write delays

### Technical Details
