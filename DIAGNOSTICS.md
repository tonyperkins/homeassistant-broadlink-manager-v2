# Diagnostics & Troubleshooting

## Submitting Issues

When submitting an issue on GitHub, please include diagnostic information to help us troubleshoot faster.

### How to Generate Diagnostics

#### **Option 1: Copy Summary (Quick)**
1. Click the **Diagnostics** button in the UI
2. Select **Copy Summary**
3. Paste into your GitHub issue

This provides a quick overview of your system configuration.

#### **Option 2: Download Full Report (Recommended)**
1. Click the **Diagnostics** button in the UI
2. Select **Download Full Report**
3. Attach the ZIP file to your GitHub issue

This includes complete diagnostic information in a sanitized format.

### What's Included

The diagnostic report includes:

#### **System Information**
- Operating system and version
- Python version
- Platform architecture

#### **Configuration**
- Storage path
- Log level
- Home Assistant connectivity status
- **Note:** Tokens and passwords are automatically removed

#### **Device Information**
- Total device count
- Device breakdown by type (Broadlink, SmartIR)
- Entity type distribution
- **Note:** Sensitive command data is removed

#### **Integration Status**
- SmartIR installation status
- Broadlink device detection

#### **Storage Information**

#### **Command Structure**
- Command file listing
- Command names and types (IR/RF)

### Privacy & Security

**All diagnostic data is automatically sanitized:**
- ‚úÖ Tokens are removed
- ‚úÖ Passwords are removed
- ‚úÖ API keys are removed
- ‚úÖ Learned IR/RF codes are removed (only command names included)
- ‚úÖ Only metadata is included

**You can review the data before sharing:**
- The ZIP file contains human-readable JSON and Markdown files
- Open and review before attaching to GitHub issues
- Remove any additional sensitive information if needed

### Manual Diagnostics

If the automatic diagnostics don't work, you can manually collect:

1. **System Info:**
   ```bash
   python --version
   uname -a  # Linux/Mac
   systeminfo  # Windows
   ```

2. **Device Count:**
   - Check `devices.json` in your storage directory
   - Count entries (don't share the full file - it contains IR/RF codes)

3. **Logs:**
   - Last 50-100 lines from the application log
   - Look for ERROR or WARNING messages

4. **Configuration:**
   - Storage path location
   - Installation type (add-on vs standalone)
   - Home Assistant version
