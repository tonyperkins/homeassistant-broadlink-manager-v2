---

### Standalone Docker Installation

For Home Assistant installations that don't support add-ons (Container, Core, or any non-Supervisor setup).

#### Prerequisites

- **Home Assistant** (any installation type: Container, Core, etc.)
- **Docker and Docker Compose** installed on your host
- **Network access** to Home Assistant
- **Access to Home Assistant's config folder** (for reading/writing command storage)
- **Long-lived access token** from Home Assistant
- At least one **Broadlink device** configured in Home Assistant

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tonyperkins/homeassistant-broadlink-manager.git
cd homeassistant-broadlink-manager

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and set your HA_URL and HA_TOKEN
nano .env

# Update docker-compose.yml with your HA config path
nano docker-compose.yml

# Start the container
docker-compose up -d
```

Access the web interface at `http://your-host-ip:8099`

#### Creating a Long-Lived Access Token

1. Open Home Assistant and click your **profile** (your name in the sidebar)
2. Scroll to **"Long-Lived Access Tokens"**
3. Click **"Create Token"**
4. Name it `Broadlink Manager` and copy the token
5. Add it to your `.env` file as `HA_TOKEN`

#### Configuration

Edit `.env` with your settings:

```env
HA_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8123  # Your Home Assistant URL
HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_token_here
LOG_LEVEL=info
WEB_PORT=8099
AUTO_DISCOVER=true
```

Update `docker-compose.yml` volume mount:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /path/to/homeassistant/config:/config  # Update this path!
```

**üìñ For detailed Docker installation instructions, see [DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md)**

---

## Configuration

### Add-on Configuration

```yaml
log_level: info
web_port: 8099
auto_discover: true
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are dealing with an unknown issue.

Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default, the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `web_port`

Sets the port for the web interface. Default is 8099. The web interface will be available at `http://homeassistant.local:8099` (replace with your Home Assistant URL).

### Option: `auto_discover`

Enables automatic discovery of Broadlink devices on your network. Default is true.

## Usage

### Learning Commands

1. **Access the Web Interface**: After starting the add-on, navigate to `http://homeassistant.local:8099` in your web browser
2. **Select Device**: Choose your Broadlink device from the dropdown
3. **Choose Room and Device**: Select the room and device name for organizing commands
4. **Learn Commands**: 
   - Add command names using the "Add Command" field
   - Click "Learn" next to each command
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to press your remote buttons
5. **Test Commands**: Use the "Test" button to verify learned commands work correctly
6. **Manage Commands**: View all learned commands and organize them by device

### Auto-Generating Home Assistant Entities

The add-on can automatically create Home Assistant entities from your learned commands:

1. **Learn your commands** with descriptive names (e.g., `light_on`, `light_off`, `fan_speed_1`, etc.)
2. **Configure entities** via the web interface:
   - The add-on will auto-detect entity types based on command names
   - You can manually adjust entity types and command roles
3. **Generate entity files** by clicking the "Generate Entities" button
4. **Add to configuration.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   light: !include broadlink_manager/entities.yaml
   fan: !include broadlink_manager/entities.yaml
   switch: !include broadlink_manager/entities.yaml
   input_boolean: !include broadlink_manager/helpers.yaml
   input_select: !include broadlink_manager/helpers.yaml
   ```
5. **Restart Home Assistant** and your entities will appear!

#### Supported Entity Types

- **Light**: Requires `light_on` and `light_off` commands (or `light_toggle`)
- **Fan**: Requires `fan_speed_X` commands and optionally `fan_off`, `fan_reverse`
  - Automatic percentage-based speed control
  - Direction control (forward/reverse) included by default
  - Supports 1-6 speed levels
- **Switch**: Requires `on` and `off` commands (or `toggle`)
- **Media Player**: Coming soon

#### Command Naming Conventions

For best auto-detection results, use these naming patterns:

- **Lights**: `light_on`, `light_off`, `light_toggle`
- **Fans**: `fan_speed_1`, `fan_speed_2`, ..., `fan_speed_6`, `fan_off`, `fan_reverse`
  - Speed commands are required (at least one)
  - `fan_off` is optional (will use lowest speed if not provided)
  - `fan_reverse` is optional (direction control will still appear in UI)
- **Switches**: `on`, `off`, `toggle`, `power`
