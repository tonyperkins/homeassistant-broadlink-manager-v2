## Rationale

### Why Archive?

These documents served their purpose during active development but are no longer needed for day-to-day reference:

- **Completion summaries** - Work is done, captured in main docs
- **Progress tracking** - No longer being updated
- **Historical milestones** - Useful for reference but not active development

### Why Keep Active Docs?

The remaining documents are still relevant:

- **Testing guides** - Actively used by developers
- **Refactoring roadmap** - Future planning
- **SmartIR integration** - Ongoing feature
- **Vue setup** - Reference for frontend work

---

## Impact

### Before
- 23 files in `docs/development/`
- Mix of active and historical documents
- Difficult to find current information

### After
- 9 active files in `docs/development/`
- 14 archived files in `docs/development/archive/`
- Clear separation of active vs. historical docs
- Archive includes README for context

## Access Archived Docs

All archived documents remain accessible at:
```
docs/development/archive/

See `docs/development/archive/README.md` for a complete index.

## Next Steps

As recommended in `CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`:

1. âœ… **Archive old development docs** - COMPLETED
2. Update API.md with current endpoints
3. Update ARCHITECTURE.md with current data model
4. Remove or implement stub API endpoints
5. Reduce logging verbosity

**Note:** This archive can be reviewed periodically. If documents are no longer needed for any reference, they can be safely deleted in a future cleanup.
