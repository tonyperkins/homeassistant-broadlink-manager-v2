## Updated Documentation

### `docs/development/README.md`

Completely reorganized to provide a clear index of development documentation:

- **Development Workflow** - Setup, process, release management
- **Architecture & Design** - System architecture, implementation guides
- **Testing** - Testing guides, test results
- **Implementation Details** - Completed features, bug fixes
- **Project Management** - Updates, communication
- **Archived Documentation** - Historical documents

### `docs/DOCS.md`

Updated main documentation index to:

- Reflect new organization with development docs in separate folder
- Update all links to point to correct locations

## Migration Guide

### For Documentation Contributors

When creating new documentation:

1. **User-facing docs** → Place in `docs/`
   - Installation guides
   - Usage instructions
   - Troubleshooting
   - API reference (user perspective)
   - Configuration guides

2. **Development docs** → Place in `docs/development/`
   - Implementation details
   - Architecture analysis
   - Testing guides
   - Development workflows
   - Technical specifications
   - Bug fix documentation
   - Phase completion summaries

3. **Update indexes**
   - Add to `docs/DOCS.md` if user-facing
   - Add to `docs/development/README.md` if development-focused

### For Link Updates

All internal documentation links have been updated. External references (README.md, etc.) may need updates if they link to moved files.

**Pattern for moved files:**
- Old: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- New: `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT.md`
