# Implementation Summary: Broadlink Manager Enhancements

## Overview

This document summarizes the two major enhancements implemented for Broadlink Manager:

1. **Explicit Broadlink Device Assignment** - Separates transmitter location from controlled device location
2. **Automatic Migration System** - Discovers and migrates existing Broadlink commands on startup

---

## Feature 1: Explicit Broadlink Device Assignment

### Problem Solved

Previously, the system relied on naming conventions to infer relationships between Broadlink devices and controlled devices. This caused issues when:
- A Broadlink in the Kitchen controlled devices in the Living Room
- Area assignments were ambiguous
- Users couldn't easily reassign commands to different Broadlink devices

### Solution

Each entity now explicitly specifies which Broadlink device transmits its commands:

```json
{
  "living_room_ceiling_fan": {
    "broadlink_entity": "remote.kitchen_broadlink",  // Which transmitter
    "area": "Living Room",                           // Where the fan is
    "commands": {...}
  }
}
```

### Implementation Details

**Files Modified:**
- `app/entity_detector.py` - Added `broadlink_entity` parameter
- `app/entity_generator.py` - Uses per-entity `broadlink_entity` instead of global device ID
- `app/web_server.py` - Updated API endpoints to handle broadlink device selection
- `app/storage_manager.py` - Enhanced README with new structure explanation

**Files Created:**
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive architecture guide
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Migration instructions and examples

### Key Benefits

✅ **Flexibility**: One Broadlink can control devices in multiple areas  
✅ **Clarity**: Explicit assignment removes ambiguity  
✅ **Scalability**: Easy to reassign commands to different Broadlink devices  
✅ **HA-aligned**: Matches Home Assistant's service-based architecture  
✅ **Backward compatible**: Existing entities continue working

## Feature 2: Automatic Migration System

### Problem Solved

Users with existing Broadlink setups (potentially hundreds of learned commands across multiple devices) would have to manually configure everything. This was:
- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- A barrier to adoption

### Solution

Automatic migration system that:
1. Scans Home Assistant storage for Broadlink command files
2. Discovers all learned commands
3. Detects entity types using pattern matching
4. Creates metadata automatically
5. Associates entities with correct Broadlink devices
6. Assigns initial areas based on Broadlink locations

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `app/migration_manager.py` - Complete migration system
- `docs/AUTO_MIGRATION.md` - Comprehensive user guide

**Files Modified:**
- `app/web_server.py` - Integrated migration on startup, added API endpoints
- `docs/API.md` - Documented migration endpoints
- `README.md` - Added migration feature highlights
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Added automatic migration section

### Migration Process

```
Startup
  ↓
Scan /config/.storage/broadlink_remote_*_codes
  ↓
Extract commands and device info
  ↓
Pattern matching (lights, fans, switches, media players)
  ↓
Create metadata entries
  ↓
Associate with Broadlink devices
  ↓
Ready to use!
```

### API Endpoints

**Get Status:**
```
GET /api/migration/status
```

**Check and Migrate:**
```
POST /api/migration/check
```

**Force Migration:**
```
POST /api/migration/force
{
  "overwrite": false
}
```

### Key Benefits

✅ **Zero configuration**: Existing commands automatically discovered  
✅ **Instant setup**: Hundreds of commands migrated in seconds  
✅ **Smart detection**: Automatically identifies entity types  
✅ **Safe**: Only runs if no metadata exists (unless forced)  
✅ **Transparent**: Detailed logging and status reporting  

---

## Pattern Detection

The migration system recognizes these command patterns:

### Lights
- `light_on`, `light_off`, `light_toggle`
- `lamp_on`, `lamp_off`, `lamp_toggle`

### Fans
- `fan_speed_1`, `fan_speed_2`, `fan_speed_3`, etc.
- `fan_off`, `fan_on`
- `fan_reverse`, `fan_direction`

### Switches
- `on`, `off`, `toggle`
- `power`, `power_on`, `power_off`

### Media Players
- `vol_up`, `vol_down`, `volume_up`, `volume_down`
- `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `play_pause`
- `ch_up`, `ch_down`, `channel_up`, `channel_down`
- `mute`, `next`, `previous`

## Data Structure

### Metadata File: `/config/broadlink_manager/metadata.json`

{
  "version": 1,

    "entity_id": {
      "entity_type": "fan",
      "device": "device_name",
      "broadlink_entity": "remote.kitchen_broadlink",
      "area": "Living Room",
      "commands": {
        "turn_off": "fan_off",
        "speed_1": "fan_speed_1",
        "speed_2": "fan_speed_2"
      },
      "friendly_name": "Living Room Ceiling Fan",
      "enabled": true,
      "auto_detected": true
    }
  },
  "migration": {
    "migrated_at": "2025-10-11T22:30:00",
    "migrated_entities": 15,
    "skipped_devices": 2,
    "errors": 0,
    "broadlink_devices": 3

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Central Broadlink

**Setup:**
- 1 Broadlink in Kitchen
- Controls devices in Living Room, Bedroom, Office

**Result:**
```json
{
  "living_room_tv": {
    "broadlink_entity": "remote.kitchen_broadlink",
    "area": "Living Room"
  },
  "bedroom_fan": {
    "broadlink_entity": "remote.kitchen_broadlink",
    "area": "Bedroom"
  },
  "office_light": {
    "broadlink_entity": "remote.kitchen_broadlink",
    "area": "Office"
  }
}
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Broadlinks

**Setup:**
- 3 Broadlinks in different rooms
- Each controls nearby devices

**Result:**
```json
{
  "living_room_tv": {
    "broadlink_entity": "remote.living_room_broadlink",
    "area": "Living Room"
  },
  "bedroom_fan": {
    "broadlink_entity": "remote.bedroom_broadlink",
    "area": "Bedroom"
  }
}
```

### Scenario 3: Existing User with 50+ Commands

**Before:**
- 50+ learned commands across 3 Broadlink devices
- No entity management
- Manual service calls required

**After Migration:**
- Automatic scan finds all commands
- Creates 20 entities (lights, fans, switches)
- Properly associated with Broadlink devices
- Ready to generate YAML
- **Time saved: Hours of manual configuration**

## Technical Architecture

### Component Relationships

```
MigrationManager
  ├─ Uses: StorageManager (save entities)
  ├─ Uses: EntityDetector (pattern matching)
  └─ Reads: /config/.storage/broadlink_remote_*_codes

EntityDetector
  ├─ Analyzes command names
  ├─ Groups by entity type
  └─ Validates entity requirements

EntityGenerator
  ├─ Reads metadata
  ├─ Uses per-entity broadlink_entity
  └─ Generates YAML configurations

WebServer
  ├─ Initializes MigrationManager
  ├─ Runs migration check on startup
  └─ Provides migration API endpoints
```

### Startup Flow

```
1. WebServer.__init__()
2. Initialize MigrationManager
3. _schedule_migration_check()
4. Background thread starts
5. Get Broadlink devices
6. migration_manager.check_and_migrate()
7. Scan storage files
8. Detect entities
9. Create metadata
10. Log results
11. Ready for use
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing Entities

✅ Continue to work without changes  
✅ Can be migrated by adding `broadlink_entity` field  
✅ Fall back to default device ID if not specified  

### Existing Commands

✅ All commands remain in Broadlink storage  
✅ Migration creates metadata, doesn't modify storage  
✅ Commands not matching patterns can be manually configured
