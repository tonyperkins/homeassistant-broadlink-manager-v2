# Phase 2: Frontend - COMPLETE âœ…

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/independent-command-storage`  
**Status:** âœ… Frontend Complete, Ready for Testing

---

## What We Built

### DirectCommandLearner Component

**File:** `frontend/src/components/commands/DirectCommandLearner.vue`

A complete state machine-based learning dialog with:

#### States
1. **ready** - Initial form (command name, IR/RF selection)
2. **learning-ir** - IR learning in progress with timer
3. **learning-rf-sweep** - RF step 1: frequency sweep
4. **learning-rf-capture** - RF step 2: signal capture
5. **success** - Command learned, show test options
6. **error** - Learning failed, show error and retry
7. **testing** - Testing command in progress
8. **test-result** - Test complete, show result

#### Features
- âœ… Real-time progress bar (0-30 seconds)
- âœ… Elapsed timer display
- âœ… Clear instructions for each state
- âœ… IR: "Point remote and press button"
- âœ… RF Step 1: "Press and HOLD for 2-3 seconds"
- âœ… RF Step 2: "Press button again (short press)"
- âœ… RF frequency display when locked
- âœ… Command details after learning (name, type, frequency, data length)
- âœ… Test options: Direct, via HA, or Skip
- âœ… Test result feedback
- âœ… "Learn Another" option after success
- âœ… Cancel button during learning
- âœ… Error handling with retry option

#### API Integration
- âœ… Calls `POST /api/commands/learn/direct`
- âœ… Calls `POST /api/commands/test/direct`
- âœ… Calls `POST /api/commands/test/ha`
- âœ… Emits `learned` event to parent
- âœ… Emits `cancel` event to close

## Integration

### DeviceList.vue Updates

**Changes:**
```vue
// Old
import CommandLearner from '../commands/CommandLearner.vue'

// New
import DirectCommandLearner from '../commands/DirectCommandLearner.vue'
```

**Usage:**
```vue
<DirectCommandLearner
  v-if="showCommandLearner"
  :device="selectedDevice"
  @learned="handleCommandLearned"
  @cancel="closeCommandLearner"
/>
```

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Manage Commands" on device card
2. `DeviceCard` emits `@learn` event
3. `DeviceList` shows `DirectCommandLearner` dialog
4. User learns command
5. Dialog emits `@learned` event
6. `DeviceList` refreshes device data
7. Device card shows updated command count

---

## User Experience

### IR Learning Flow
```
1. User clicks "Manage Commands" on device card
2. Dialog opens: "Learn Command: Living Room TV"
3. User enters command name: "power"
4. User selects "IR (Infrared)"
5. User clicks "Start Learning"
6. Dialog shows: "Point your remote at the Broadlink device and press the button"
7. Progress bar animates (0-30s)
8. Timer shows: "5s / 30s"
9. User presses remote button
10. Dialog shows: "Command Learned Successfully!"
11. Shows command details (name, type, data length)
12. Dialog shows test options:
    - Test Direct (python-broadlink)
    - Test via HA (remote.send_command)
    - Skip Testing
13. User clicks "Test Direct"
14. Command sent, device responds
15. Dialog shows: "Test Successful! Command sent successfully via direct connection"
16. User clicks "Learn Another Command" or "Done"
```

### RF Learning Flow
```
1-5. Same as IR
6. Dialog shows: "RF Learning - Step 1 of 2"
   "Press and HOLD the button for 2-3 seconds"
   "Scanning for RF frequency..."
7. Progress bar animates
8. User holds button for 2-3 seconds
9. Dialog shows: "RF Frequency Locked! 433.92 MHz"
   "Now press the button again (short press)"
10. User presses button (short press)
11. Dialog shows: "Command Learned Successfully!"
12-16. Same as IR (with frequency shown in details)
```

## Component Architecture

### Props
```javascript
{
  device: {
    type: Object,
    required: true
    // Expected: { id, entity_id, friendly_name, name }
  }
}
```

### Events
```javascript
// Emitted when command learned successfully
emit('learned', {
  deviceId: 'living_room_tv',
  commandName: 'power',
  commandType: 'ir'
})

// Emitted when dialog closed
emit('cancel')
```

### State Management
```javascript
const state = ref('ready')
const commandName = ref('')
const commandType = ref('ir')
const elapsed = ref(0)
const progressPercent = computed(() => (elapsed.value / 30) * 100)
const rfFrequency = ref(null)
const dataLength = ref(0)
const errorMessage = ref('')
const testing = ref(null)
const testSuccess = ref(false)
const testMethod = ref('')
```

### Timer Management
```javascript
let timer = null
let startTime = null

const startTimer = () => {
  startTime = Date.now()
  elapsed.value = 0
  timer = setInterval(() => {
    elapsed.value = Math.floor((Date.now() - startTime) / 1000)
  }, 100)
}

const stopTimer = () => {
  if (timer) {
    clearInterval(timer)
    timer = null
  }
}

onUnmounted(() => {
  stopTimer() // Cleanup
})
```

## Styling

### Design System
- Uses HA CSS variables for theming
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Smooth transitions between states
- Loading spinners for async operations
- Color-coded states:
  - Primary: Learning, testing
  - Success: Green checkmarks
  - Error: Red alerts
  - Info: Blue frequency display

### Key Classes
- `.modal-overlay` - Full-screen backdrop
- `.modal-content` - Dialog container
- `.learning-state` - Learning UI
- `.success-state` - Success UI
- `.error-state` - Error UI
- `.progress-bar` - Animated progress
- `.test-options` - Test button group

---

## Error Handling

### Timeout Errors
```
"Timeout - no IR signal detected within 30 seconds"
"Timeout - no RF signal detected within 30 seconds"
```

### Network Errors
```
"Failed to authenticate with device"
"Could not get connection info for remote.living_room_rm4_pro"
```

### User Actions
- **Retry** - Returns to ready state
- **Close** - Closes dialog
- **Try Different Test** - Returns to success state

- [ ] Test direct - success
- [ ] Test direct - failure
- [ ] Test via HA - success
- [ ] Test via HA - failure

- [ ] Error retry flow
- [ ] Timer accuracy
- [ ] Progress bar animation
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Device card shows updated command count
- [ ] Device list refreshes after learning
- [ ] Multiple commands can be learned in sequence
- [ ] Dialog closes properly
- [ ] No memory leaks (timer cleanup)

## Next Steps

### Remaining Work
1. **Update DeviceCard** - Show test status badges on commands
2. **Add command management** - View/edit/delete learned commands
3. **Entity generation** - Update to use base64 from devices.json
4. **Documentation** - User guide for direct learning
5. **E2E tests** - Playwright tests for learning flow

### Future Enhancements
- Command categories/groups
- Bulk command learning
- Command templates
- Import/export commands
- Command history/versioning
