## User-Facing Documentation

For user-facing documentation (installation, usage, API reference, etc.), see the main [docs](../) folder.

## Document Lifecycle

### Active Documents
Documents currently being used for ongoing development work. These should be kept up-to-date as implementation progresses.

### Completion Summaries
Historical records of completed work. These are kept for reference but are not actively updated.

### Archived Documents
When a development phase is complete and the document is no longer needed for active reference, consider moving it to an `archive/` subfolder or removing it if the information is captured elsewhere.

## Contributing

When creating new development documents:

1. Use descriptive, ALL_CAPS filenames with underscores
2. Include a clear overview and goals section
3. Break down implementation into phases
4. Add status and date information
5. Link to related documents
6. Update this README with a reference to the new document
