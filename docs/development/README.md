## Document Lifecycle

### Active Documents
Documents currently being used for ongoing development work. These should be kept up-to-date as implementation progresses.

### Completion Summaries
Historical records of completed work (PHASE*_COMPLETE.md). These are kept for reference but are not actively updated.

### Archived Documents
When a development phase is complete and the document is no longer needed for active reference, it should be moved to the `archive/` subfolder.

---

## Contributing

When creating new development documents:

1. **Filename**: Use descriptive, ALL_CAPS filenames with underscores
2. **Structure**: Include overview, goals, implementation phases
3. **Metadata**: Add status, date, and version information
4. **Links**: Link to related documents
5. **Update**: Update this README with a reference to the new document
6. **Location**: Place in appropriate section above
