# Testing Framework Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive testing framework has been implemented for the Broadlink Manager add-on, combining automated testing with detailed manual test procedures.

## What's Included

### 1. Automated Testing Framework

**Framework**: pytest with Flask integration + Playwright for E2E

**Test Files Created**:
- `pytest.ini` - Test configuration
- `requirements-test.txt` - Test dependencies (including Playwright)
- `tests/conftest.py` - Shared fixtures and configuration
- `tests/unit/test_device_manager.py` - DeviceManager unit tests (20+ tests)
- `tests/unit/test_area_manager.py` - AreaManager unit tests
- `tests/integration/test_api_endpoints.py` - API endpoint integration tests
- `tests/e2e/test_ui_navigation.py` - Browser UI navigation tests
- `tests/e2e/test_device_management.py` - Device management workflow tests
- `tests/e2e/test_command_learning.py` - Command learning UI tests
- `tests/e2e/test_accessibility.py` - Accessibility tests

**Features**:
- ✅ Unit tests for core managers (DeviceManager, AreaManager)
- ✅ Integration tests for API endpoints
- ✅ E2E browser tests with Playwright (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- ✅ Mobile and tablet responsive testing
- ✅ Accessibility testing (keyboard nav, ARIA, screen readers)
- ✅ Code coverage reporting (HTML + terminal)
- ✅ Test fixtures for common scenarios
- ✅ Mock objects for Home Assistant API and Broadlink devices
- ✅ Automatic screenshots on test failure
- ✅ Test markers for categorization (unit, integration, e2e, a11y, slow, requires_device)

### 2. Manual Test Plan

**Document**: `docs/TESTING.md`

**Coverage**:
- Installation and startup scenarios (fresh, upgrade, migration)
- Device management workflows
- Command learning (IR/RF)
- Command testing
- Entity generation and Home Assistant integration
- Area management
- Error handling
- Performance testing
- Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile responsiveness (phone, tablet)

**Format**: Checklist-style with pass/fail tracking

### 3. Quick Start Guide

**Document**: `TESTING_QUICKSTART.md`

Get developers testing in 5 minutes with:
- Installation instructions
- Common test commands
- Quick examples
- Debugging tips

### 4. CI/CD Integration

**File**: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

**Features**:
- Automated testing on push/PR
- Multi-Python version testing (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Code coverage reporting
- Linting (flake8, black)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Security scanning (bandit, safety)
- Artifact uploads for coverage reports

## Quick Start

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest

# With coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Unit tests only (fast)
pytest -m unit

# Integration tests
pytest -m integration
```

### View Coverage

```bash
# Windows
start htmlcov/index.html

# macOS
open htmlcov/index.html

# Linux
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Test Coverage Goals

| Module | Target Coverage |
|--------|----------------|
| device_manager.py | 90% |
| area_manager.py | 90% |
| storage_manager.py | 85% |
| entity_generator.py | 80% |
| web_server.py | 75% |
| migration_manager.py | 80% |

**Overall Target**: > 80%

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (`@pytest.mark.unit`)
- Fast, isolated tests
- Test individual functions/methods
- No external dependencies
- Run frequently during development

### Integration Tests (`@pytest.mark.integration`)
- Test API endpoints
- Test component interactions
- May use test database/storage
- Run before commits

### Slow Tests (`@pytest.mark.slow`)
- Performance tests
- Large dataset tests
- Can be skipped for quick feedback

### Device-Required Tests (`@pytest.mark.requires_device`)
- Require actual Broadlink hardware
- Skipped in CI/CD
- Run manually before releases

## Key Test Scenarios

### Automated Tests Cover:
1. Device CRUD operations
2. Command management
3. Area management
4. API endpoint responses
5. Error handling
6. Data validation
7. ID generation
8. Filtering and queries

### Manual Tests Cover:
1. Command learning with real remotes
2. Command testing with real devices
3. Entity generation and HA integration
4. Web UI interactions
5. Browser compatibility
6. Mobile responsiveness
7. Performance with large datasets
8. Network disconnection handling

## Running Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Fast feedback during development
pytest -m unit -x

# Before committing
pytest -m "not requires_device"

# Full test suite
pytest

# Specific module
pytest tests/unit/test_device_manager.py

# Specific test
pytest tests/unit/test_device_manager.py::TestDeviceManager::test_create_device

# With verbose output
pytest -v

# Stop on first failure
pytest -x

# Show print statements
pytest -s

# Drop into debugger on failure
pytest --pdb
```

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing code:

```bash
# 1. Run tests
pytest

# 2. Check coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing

# 3. Lint code

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Install test dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-test.txt`
2. Run tests: `pytest`
3. Review coverage: `pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html`

### Short Term
1. Add tests for remaining modules (storage_manager, entity_generator)
2. Increase coverage to > 80%
3. Complete manual test plan for current release

### Long Term
1. Add end-to-end tests with Playwright
2. Add performance benchmarks
3. Add mutation testing
4. Integrate with code quality tools (SonarQube, etc.)
