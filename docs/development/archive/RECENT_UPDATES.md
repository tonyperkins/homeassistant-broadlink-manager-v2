# Recent Updates - Fan Direction Support & Auto-Reload

## Summary

This document summarizes the recent improvements made to the Broadlink Manager addon, focusing on fan entity generation and automatic configuration reloading.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fan Direction Support (Always Enabled)

**File:** `app/entity_generator.py`

- All fan entities now include direction control by default
- Direction control appears in UI even if `fan_reverse` command hasn't been learned yet
- If `fan_reverse` command exists, it will be sent when toggling direction
- If no command exists, only the state tracker (`input_select`) is updated

**Benefits:**
- Mushroom Fan Card and other fan cards now show direction toggle
- Users can learn the reverse command later without regenerating entities
- Consistent UI experience across all fan entities

### 2. Improved Fan Off Command Handling

**File:** `app/entity_generator.py`

- `turn_off` action now uses `fan_off` command if available
- Falls back to lowest speed (`fan_speed_1`) if `fan_off` not learned
- `set_percentage` action uses `fan_off` when percentage is 0

**Benefits:**
- Proper fan off behavior when dedicated off command exists
- Graceful fallback for fans without separate off command

### 3. Enhanced Command Sync

**File:** `app/web_server.py` - `_map_device_commands_to_entity_commands()`

Added support for fan-specific commands during metadata sync:
- All commands starting with `fan_` prefix (e.g., `fan_off`, `fan_reverse`)
- Commands named `reverse` or `direction`

**Benefits:**
- Fan commands properly sync from `.storage` files to `metadata.json`
- Entity generator has access to all fan-related commands

### 4. Automatic Configuration Reload

**File:** `app/web_server.py` - `/api/entities/generate` endpoint

The "Generate Entities" button now automatically:
1. Generates YAML entity files
2. Reloads Broadlink integration config entries
3. Reloads Home Assistant YAML configuration (template entities)

**Benefits:**
- No manual config reload required in Home Assistant
- New entities appear immediately after generation
- Seamless user experience

## Technical Details

### Entity Generator Changes

```python
# Always enable direction support
has_direction = True  # Previously conditional

# Build set_direction actions
if direction_command:
    # Send remote command if available
    set_direction_actions.append({
        'service': 'remote.send_command',
        'data': {'command': direction_command}
    })

# Always update state tracker
set_direction_actions.append({
    'service': 'input_select.select_option',
    'data': {'option': "{% if direction == 'forward' %}reverse{% else %}forward{% endif %}"}
})
```

### Command Mapping Changes

```python
# Added to _map_device_commands_to_entity_commands()
elif cmd_name.startswith('fan_'):
    # Other fan-specific commands (fan_off, fan_reverse, etc.)
    entity_commands[cmd_name] = cmd_name
elif cmd_lower in ['reverse', 'direction']:
    # Direction/reverse commands for fans
    entity_commands[cmd_name] = cmd_name
```

### Auto-Reload Implementation

```python
# In /api/entities/generate endpoint
if result.get('success'):
    # Reload Broadlink configuration
    reload_success = loop.run_until_complete(self._reload_broadlink_config())
    
    # Reload YAML configuration to pick up new template entities
    yaml_reload_success = loop.run_until_complete(self.area_manager.reload_config())
    
    if reload_success and yaml_reload_success:
        result['config_reloaded'] = True
```

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files

1. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Added unreleased section with all new features and fixes

2. **README.md**
   - Updated fan entity description with direction control info
   - Enhanced command naming conventions section

3. **docs/ENTITY_GENERATION.md**
   - Added detailed fan entity configuration example
   - Documented direction control behavior
   - Updated API response to include `config_reloaded` field
   - Added note about automatic reload

4. **docs/API.md**
   - Updated `/api/entities/generate` endpoint documentation
   - Added `config_reloaded` field to response
   - Added note about automatic configuration reload

## User Impact

### Before
- Users had to manually reload configuration in Home Assistant after generating entities
- Direction control only appeared if `fan_reverse` command was learned before generation
- `fan_off` command was not used even if available

### After
- Configuration automatically reloads after entity generation
- Direction control always available in fan cards
- Proper fan off behavior with dedicated command
- All fan-specific commands properly recognized and synced

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test fan entity generation with various command combinations:**
   - Only speed commands (no off, no reverse)
   - Speed commands + fan_off
   - Speed commands + fan_reverse
   - All commands present

2. **Test automatic reload:**
   - Generate entities
   - Verify entities appear immediately in Home Assistant
   - Check logs for reload success messages

3. **Test direction control:**
   - Verify direction toggle appears in Mushroom Fan Card
   - Test with and without `fan_reverse` command learned
   - Verify state tracking works correctly

4. **Test command sync:**
   - Learn new fan commands
   - Generate entities
   - Verify all commands appear in metadata.json

## Migration Notes

No migration required for existing users. Changes are backward compatible:
- Existing fan entities will gain direction control on next regeneration
- Existing configurations continue to work as before
- No breaking changes to API or file formats
